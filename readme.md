Various stuff that is either too insignificant or too boring to put elsewhere.
(extra poorly tested)

* `dotbin` contains some scripts i use, particularly the window switching one
  might be interesting.

* `arduino/` contains a bunch of little fairly trivial arduino libs.

* `relax`: relaxation method for solving laplace equation.(voltage)
  Uses doubling of the size of the grid to do it pretty fast.

* `hashtable`: Hash table implementation and s-expression(nested lists) parser.

* `en-morse`: turning stuff into morse code, playing it as audio.

* `prog-select`: gives you a list of commands ordered by number of times used
  as you type. used it for a while to activate programs quickly. Approach
  wasn't as good as hoped, besides many options of similar programs.

* `old_found/Pong3d`: contains an 3d pong thingy i wrote ages ago.
