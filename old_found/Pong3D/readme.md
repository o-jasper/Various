Old stuff from 2006, just gonna make it work for fun.(on linux)

Just needed to remove `SDL_thread.h` it didnt use and add a makefile. The code
is probably a bunch longer than it needs to be.

Only `Makefile`, `SDL_main.cpp`, `Particle_Wall3D.cpp`, `Pong3D.cpp`, `Pong3d` 
do stuff, the others are old windows stuff `Pong3d.exe` might or might not still
work..
