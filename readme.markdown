Various stuff that is either too insignificant or too boring to put elsewhere.
(extra poorly tested)

* `relax`: relaxation method for solving laplace equation.(voltage)
  Uses doubling of the size of the grid to do it pretty fast.

* `en-morse`: turning stuff into morse code, playing it as audio.

* `prog-select`: used it for a while to activate programs quickly. Approach
  wasn't as good as hoped.
  (Now i have something that 'works as alt-tab' but has different categories
  of windows, and starts a program if none of that category already running)
